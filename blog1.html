  <h1>ðŸŽ® How to Earn from Mobile Games (2025 Guide)</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Sahidoona's blog! If you're looking for smart ways to earn money from mobile games, you're in the right place.</p>

  <h3>1. Use Game Affiliate Platforms</h3>
  <p>I recommend <a href="https://affiliate.gamemania.cc/creative/mobile?code=82w3nv" target="_blank">GameMania</a>. You earn when people play games through your link.</p>

  <h3>2. Monetize Your Website with AdSense</h3>
  <p>As you grow your traffic, Google AdSense can pay you for ads shown on your blog and game pages.</p>

  <h3>3. Share Tips & Get Followers</h3>
  <p>Start a YouTube, TikTok or Instagram page and link to your site â€” more traffic = more money.</p>
